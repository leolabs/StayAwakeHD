# About StayAwake HD

StayAwake HD is a one-day project by Leo Bernard aka leolabs. I created this app using TideSDK which is still in development but already stable enough for this kind of apps. This is my first multi-platform project, so if you have suggestions, ideas, or anything else, just leave me a message on Twitter @leolabs_org.

So how does StayAwake HD work? The idea behind this app is fairly simple. Some external hard drives, like the WD MyBook, turn themselves off when they aren't used for a while. When you want to open the Finder or Explorer, the system will sometimes freeze until the hard drive has started again, which can take some time. StayAwake HD creates and modifies a file on these external hard drives so they won't turn off anymore. This resolves the issues mentioned above and some other problems.
